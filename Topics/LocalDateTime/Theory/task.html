Fields in a class describe the properties of an object, while methods describe what an object can do. Classes can be divided into two groups: instance and static. Instance methods are unique to each instance of a class and can access and modify the state of that instance.

The `Duration` class also provides methods to get the hour, minute, second, and nanosecond of a `Duration` instance, as well as methods to add or subtract time units.">nanosecond</a> precision.</p>
<h5 id="creating-localdatetime-and-current-time" style="text-align: center;">Creating LocalDateTime and current time</h5>
<p>An instance of <code class="language-java">LocalDateTime</code> that represents <strong>this </strong>current moment can be obtained as below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now(); // this moment</code></pre>
<p>The class has static methods <code class="language-java">of</code> and <code class="language-java">parse</code> to create instances:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDateTime dt1 = LocalDateTime.of(2017, 11, 25, 22, 30);  // 25 November 2017, 22:30
LocalDateTime dt2 = LocalDateTime.parse("2017-11-25T22:30"); // 25 November 2017, 22:30</code></pre>
<p>It's also possible to obtain an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3495" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance refers to a specific object created from a class blueprint. | It contains its own set of unique attributes and behaviors. When a class is instantiated, memory is allocated for that instance, and it is given a unique identity. This allows multiple objects of the same class to exist, each with their own state and behavior. In contrast, static elements are shared among all instances of a class and are not unique to each object. Understanding instances is crucial in Java as it enables you to create and manipulate objects, making your program interactive and dynamic.">instance</a> from the instances of <code class="language-java">LocalDate</code> and <code class="language-java">LocalTime</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2017, 11, 25); // 2017-11-25
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(21, 30); // 21:30
        
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time); // 2017-11-25T21:30</code></pre>
<p>or by using special instance methods of <code class="language-java">LocalDate</code> and <code class="language-java">LocalTime</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2017, 11, 25); // 2017-11-25
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(21, 30); // 21:30

<p>Now let's observe some <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method is a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It consists of a set of modifiers, a return type, a name, a list of parameters, and a body. Methods may or may not return a value, which is indicated by the use of the void keyword. When a method is called, it can take zero or more arguments as input, which are the parameters defined in the method. Methods help to structure code, promote reusability, and make it easier to maintain.">methods</a> of the <code class="language-java">LocalDateTime</code> class. We've  already created an instance <code class="language-java">dateTime</code> to represent the 25 of November, 2017, 10:30 pm :</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2017, 11, 25, 22, 30); // 25 November 2017, 22:30
</code></pre>
<p>The class <code class="language-java">LocalDateTime</code> has methods for obtaining units of date and time, such as a month, day of the month, hour and minute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int month = dateTime.getMonthValue(); // 11
int day = dateTime.getDayOfMonth(); // 25
int hour = dateTime.getHour(); // 22
int minute = dateTime.getMinute(); // 30</code></pre>
<p>The class also has instance methods <code class="language-java">toLocalDate</code> and <code class="language-java">toLocalTime</code> to get the date and time as the whole parts of <code class="language-java">LocalDateTime</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDate dateOf = dateTime.toLocalDate(); // 2017-11-25
LocalTime timeOf = dateTime.toLocalTime(); // 22:30</code></pre>
<h5 id="arithmetic-methods-of-localdatetime" style="text-align: center;">Arithmetic methods of LocalDateTime</h5>
<p>The class has methods to add, subtract and alter years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds as well as <code class="language-java">LocalDate</code> and <code class="language-java">LocalTime</code>. Let's explore them with a different example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDateTime endOf2017 = LocalDateTime.of(2017, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59); // 2017-12-31T23:59:59
</code></pre>
<p>This is how by adding one second we get into another year or move by years: </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDateTime beginningOf2018 = endOf2017.plusSeconds(1); // 2018-01-01T00:00
LocalDateTime beginningOf2020 = beginningOf2018.plusYears(2); // 2020-01-01T00:00

</code></pre>
<p>We can also alter the constituents of the <code class="language-java">LocalDateTime</code> by indicating its values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">LocalDateTime beginningOf2020 = beginningOf2018.withYear(2020); // 2020-01-01T00:00</code></pre>

If we need to modify the value of an immutable object, we should create a new object instead. A common example of an immutable object is the String class, where all string operations produce a new string. This is because strings in Java are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. Immutable objects provide several benefits, including thread safety, prevention of unintended modification, and the ability to cache frequently used instances. To create an immutable object, all fields of the class should be final, and any method that appears to modify the object should actually create and return a new instance with the desired change.">immutable</a> </strong>class from the <code class="language-java">java.time</code> package.
