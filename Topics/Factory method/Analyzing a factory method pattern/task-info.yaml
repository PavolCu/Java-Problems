  - text: The Factory Method Pattern creates new instances by copying a prototype instance.
  - text: CircleFactory and SquareFactory are Concrete Creators implementing the Factory
      method declared in the abstract ShapeFactory Creator class.
  - text: "Since createShape() method in ShapeFactory class is abstract, it forces all\
    \ the subclasses to provide their own implementations for creating objects, thereby\
    \ encapsulating object creation."
  - text: "There&#x27;s a violation of the Factory Method pattern, as Concrete Creators\
    \ should not return specific concrete product instances, but should stick to returning\
    \ the abstract product type."
