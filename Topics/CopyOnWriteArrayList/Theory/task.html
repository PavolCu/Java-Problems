<p>You are becoming a more experienced developer and conquering the peaks of multithreading. And today, our guest is the <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> class, a member of the <code class="language-java">java.util.concurrent</code> package. Look closely at the name: <code class="language-java">ArrayList</code> plus the copy-on-write technique. Together, they give you a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/20768" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, thread-safety refers to the ability of a program to function correctly when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. | When shared data is accessed by multiple threads, there can be issues related to visibility and atomicity. To address these issues, Java provides the concept of a monitor, which is a special mechanism that controls concurrent access to an object. Each object in Java has an associated implicit monitor, and a thread can acquire a monitor, preventing other threads from acquiring it until the owner releases it. When it comes to collections, classic collections like ArrayList, HashMap, and HashSet are not thread-safe, which means that they do not provide thread-safety guarantees. As a result, when multiple threads access and modify these collections concurrently, it can lead to problems such as data inconsistency or runtime exceptions. To address this, Java provides synchronized collections like Vector, Hashtable, and Collections.synchronizedList, which are thread-safe but have lower performance.">thread-safe</a> representation of the <code class="language-java">ArrayList</code> class. </p>
<h5 id="copyonwritearraylist">CopyOnWriteArrayList</h5>
<p>Note that <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> is an "old class" — it has existed since Java 5.</p>
<p>The creation of a <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> looks like the creation of an <code class="language-java">ArrayList</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;String&gt; onWriteArrayList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;&gt;();</code></pre>
<p>Now let's look at how its methods allow thread safety. Imagine that our <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="List in memory" height="333" src="https://ucarecdn.com/eb9631f8-aa5f-427a-928a-6a74ca828048/" width="1474"/></picture></p>
<p>We want to add a new element to the end of this list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">onWriteArrayList.add("List!"); </code></pre>
<p> These are the steps the <code class="language-java">add</code> method goes through:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="the steps the add method" height="1146" src="https://ucarecdn.com/5d79f9ba-d96c-4a24-8bcc-21dc2ef063de/" width="1474"/></picture></p>
<p>First, a lock is set. Second, a copy of our list will be created. Third, the copy is updated with a new element. Then, our list is set to the updated copy. The final step is to unlock. This technique is called <strong>Copy-On-Write</strong><em> </em>and it ensures thread safety.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All mutative operations (<code class="language-java">add</code>, <code class="language-java">set</code>, <code class="language-java">remove</code>, etc.) use the copy-on-write technique: they create a cloned copy of the original list. As a consequence, performing many update operations can be very costly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are curious about the details of <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>s, you should know that their underlying structure is an array of <code class="language-java">Object</code>s.</p>
<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, the highlight of our program — two threads but only one list.</p>
<h5 id="two-threads-one-list">Two threads, one list</h5>
<p>Here is an example with two threads: <code class="language-java">main</code> and <code class="language-java">writer</code>. Both of them add numbers to the same <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; onWriteArrayList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    Thread writer = new Thread(() -&gt; addNumbers(onWriteArrayList));
    writer.start();

    addNumbers(onWriteArrayList); // add numbers from the main thread

    writer.join(); // wait for the writer thread to finish

    System.out.println(onWriteArrayList.size()); // the result is always the same
}

private static void addNumbers(CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100_000; i++) {
        list.add(i);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If you try to run this code, the result will always be 200_000.</p>
<p>But what if one thread added numbers while the second thread removed them?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; onWriteArrayList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;&gt;();


    Thread writer = new Thread(() -&gt; addNumbers(onWriteArrayList));
    writer.start();

    removeNumbers(onWriteArrayList); // remove numbers from the main thread

    writer.join(); // wait for the writer thread to finish

    System.out.println(onWriteArrayList.size()); // the result is always the same
}

private static void addNumbers(CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100_000; i++) {
        list.add(i);
    }
}

private static void removeNumbers(CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {
    int index = 0;
    while (index &lt; 100_000) {
        if (!list.isEmpty()) {
            list.remove(0);
            index++;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we wanted to add 100_000 numbers and remove 100_000 numbers from the same list. Everything works fine, thanks to the copy-on-write<em> </em>technique. While an element is added, the removal is paused and vice versa. But you can never guarantee that the selected index will exist at any moment. That's why we were removing only the zero-index elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you perform any <code class="language-java">read</code> operations while updating the list, you will always get the "old" version of the list, that is, how your list looked before the update started.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="what-about-iterators">What about iterators?</h5>
<p>Let's consider a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; onWriteArrayList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList&lt;&gt;();
onWriteArrayList.add(1);
onWriteArrayList.add(2);
onWriteArrayList.add(3);

Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; iterator = onWriteArrayList.iterator();

onWriteArrayList.add(4);

while(iterator.hasNext()) {
    System.out.print(iterator.next() + " "); // we will see only "1 2 3"
}</code></pre>
<p>Do you think we will see three or four elements? The answer is only three. The iterator uses an <strong>immutable snapshot</strong> of the <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>, which is created when the iterator is requested. </p>
<p>Also, because of the immutability, you can't use <code class="language-java">iterator.remove()</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> allows thread-safe iterating over its elements while the underlying list gets modified by other threads.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>s come to the rescue when you'd like to use <code class="language-java">ArrayList</code>s in a multithreading environment.</p>
<p>What to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> creates a new internal copy for every update operation (with the copy-on-write technique).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">Read</code> operations return the "old" version of the list while an update operation is in progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> iterators use an immutable snapshot of the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's very costly to update <code class="language-java">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code> often.</p>
