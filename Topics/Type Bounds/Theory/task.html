<h2>Type Bounds</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>In previous articles, we have mentioned that generics can accept any type of parameter and make it possible to reuse some code. Let's now consider an example that will reveal another aspect of generics. Imagine that we have a generic <code class="language-java">Storage&lt;T&gt;</code> class that can contain objects of any class. But there are some situations in which we want to restrict these <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an object is an instance of a particular class that defines its properties and possible behaviors. | Each object has its own state, separated from other objects, and is accessed using a reference, which stores the memory address where the actual object is located. Objects from the standard library, such as String and Date, as well as programmer-defined classes, are all reference types. The new keyword is used to create an object of a particular class. For example, String str = new String(hello); creates a new String object with the value hello. Objects have a unique identity, can be managed, and have a human-readable representation.">objects</a>. We can say, for example, that the storage has to be able to contain only books. In these types of situations, we should use type bounds.</p>
<h5 id="usage">Usage</h5>
<p>Let us take a closer look at type bounds. Consider this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Storage&lt;T&gt; {
    private T nameOfElements;
    //other methods
}</code></pre>
<p>We can put any type of object inside <code class="language-java">Storage&lt;T&gt;</code>. As stated earlier, we would like to limit this class to be able to store only books. Let's assume we have a <code class="language-java">Books</code> class to represent all books. Then we can implement our limitation by adding  <code class="language-java">&lt;T extends Books&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Storage&lt;T extends Books&gt; {
    private T nameOfElements;
    //other methods
}</code></pre>
<p>Let us create three classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Books { }
public class Brochures extends Books { }
public class Computers { }</code></pre>
<p>Now creating three <code class="language-java">Storage</code> objects will lead to different results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Storage&lt;Books&gt; storage1 = new Storage&lt;&gt;(); //no problem
Storage&lt;Brochures&gt; storage2 = new Storage&lt;&gt;(); //no problem
Storage&lt;Computers&gt; storage3 = new Storage&lt;&gt;(); //a compile-time error</code></pre>
<p>The first two lines will compile without problems. The third one, however, will return an error: <code class="language-java">Type parameter 'Computers' is not within its bound; should extend Books.</code> Since this is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a compile-time error is a type of error that prevents a Java program from being compiled due to issues such as syntax errors, incorrect keyword usage, missing symbols, improper source code file names, invocation of non-existing methods, and other issues. | These errors are different from run-time errors, which occur during the execution of a program. Compile-time errors are typically easier to identify and fix because they prevent the program from compiling, while run-time errors may not be discovered until the program is running.">compile-time error</a>, we catch this problem before it can appear in a real application. For this reason, type bounds are safe to use. </p>

<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that <code class="language-java">extends</code> can mean not only an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3596" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an extension refers to the extension mechanism that allows for the loading of classes from a secondary source, typically a directory or a jar file, in addition to the system classpath. | This mechanism is implemented by the Extension ClassLoader, which is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) architecture. When a class is requested, the Extension ClassLoader first checks if the class has already been loaded. If not, it delegates the request to its parent class loader, which is typically the system class loader. This mechanism allows for modularization and extension of the Java platform and applications.">extension</a> of a certain class but also an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/36545" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an implementation refers to the specific way of implementing a method or an interface. | It provides the concrete functionality for the methods declared in an interface. In the context of the provided passage, there are many implementations of the interface in Java, each backed by different principles. For instance, when you have an interface that represents a map, there might be several classes implementing this interface, each providing a different way to order and store data. Implementations help to extend functionality and maintain backward compatibility in Java.">implementation</a> of an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an interface is a reference type that contains method declarations and serves as a literal interface between a class inheriting that interface and another class. | Unlike a class, an interface can extend multiple interfaces, and a class can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces help to abstract from specific classes and emphasize functionality, making software design more reusable and clean. They cannot be instantiated, and the main idea of an interface is declaring functionality. Interfaces are a special kind of class that represents a map (or dictionary) for storing key-value pairs where the type of the key and the type of the stored value are specified. A real-world example of a map is a phone book where keys are the names of your friends, and values are their phone numbers. The Map interface is not a subtype of the Collection interface, but maps are often considered a collection since they are part of the collection framework and have similar methods.">interface</a>. Generally speaking, this word is used as a replacement for an extension of normal classes, not <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a generic class is a class that is parameterized over a type, allowing it to handle different data types in a uniform manner. | The type parameter is specified within angle brackets following the class name, and it can be used within the class body for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables. The concrete type is determined when an object of the class is created or a method is invoked. Only reference types, such as arrays, standard classes, or custom classes, can be used as concrete types for generic classes. This approach enables the writing of more abstract and reusable code, as the same class or method can process multiple types in the same way.">generic classes</a>.

<h5 id="principles">Principles</h5>
<p>Type bounding involves two keywords, "extends" and "super", each with their own rules regulating their utilization. In this topic, however, we deal with the most common use of type bounds: setting an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9455" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an upper bound is a feature used to set a maximum limit for a type in a generic context. | It is set with the extends keyword and indicates that a type must be a subtype of the specified type or implement the specified interface. This is useful when you want to restrict the types that can be used with a generic class or method. For example, if you have a library that stores different types of books, you can use an upper bound to ensure that only book-related types are stored, such as NormalBook and Booklet, and not other medium types like AudioRecording.">upper bound</a> with the "extends" keyword. We will learn more about the principles underlying these <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the programming language and is reserved for a specific use. | Keywords cannot be used as variable names in your own program. They have a predefined purpose in the Java language and are used by the Java compiler to parse and understand the code. Examples of keywords include public, class, and void. Understanding keywords is crucial for writing valid Java code and for debugging any syntax errors that may occur.">keywords</a> in the "Wildcards" topic. </p>
<p>Note that under the hood, every <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type variable is a type parameter that is declared in a class or method and is used to represent a concrete type that will be specified when an instance of the class or method is created. | Type variables are used for fields, method arguments, return values, and local variables within the class. They allow for flexibility and reusability by enabling the creation of classes and methods that can process different types in the same way. Only reference types, such as arrays, standard classes, or custom classes, can be used as concrete types for generic type variables.">type variable</a> declared as a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type parameter is a placeholder for a specific type used in a class or method declaration. | It is defined within angle brackets following the class or method name. Once declared, a type parameter can be used within the class or method body as an ordinary type. The advantage of using type parameters is that they enable you to write more abstract code and develop reusable software libraries. At the time of creating an object of the class or invoking the method, a concrete type is determined for the type parameter.">type parameter</a> has a bound. If no bound is declared, <code class="language-java">Object</code> is the bound. For this reason,</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SomeClass&lt;T&gt; {...}</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SomeClass&lt;T extends Object&gt; {...}</code></pre>
<h5 id="multiple-bounds">Multiple bounds</h5>
<p>A type variable may have a single <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type bound is a constraint placed on a type parameter in a generic class or interface. | It specifies that the type parameter must be, at a minimum, a specific class or implement certain interfaces. This is used to restrict the types that can be used as arguments for the type parameter, ensuring type safety. A type bound can include both a class and one or more interfaces, with the class (if present) specified first. If no explicit bound is declared, then the default bound is the Object class.">type bound</a>: </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">&lt;T extends A&gt;</code></pre>
<p>or have multiple bounds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">&lt;T extends A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; ...&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The first type bound ("A") can be a class or an interface. The rest of the type bounds ("B" onwards) must be interfaces.</p>
<p>Note: if <code class="language-java">T</code> has a bound that is a class, this class must be specified first! Otherwise, a compile-time error arises:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">&lt;T extends B &amp; C &amp; A &amp; ...&gt; //an error if A is a class</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Type bounds are widely used to restrict type parameters. The most common use of type bounds is to set upper bounds with the <code class="language-java">extends</code> keyword. Certain situations, however, require the use of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9455" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, wildcards are a specific tool used to implement compatibility between different generic objects. | They are represented by the ? sign and are used to indicate that a class, method, or field is compatible with different type parameters. Since generic are type-safe structures, it is impossible to introduce inheritance for generic objects. Wildcards help to address this issue by providing a way to set an upper or lower bound for a generic type, allowing for a certain level of compatibility and flexibility when working with generic objects.">wildcards</a>, a topic closely related to type bounds.
