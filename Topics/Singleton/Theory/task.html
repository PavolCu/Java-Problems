<h2>Singleton</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes we need to have only a single instance of a class shared across an entire application. There is a special design pattern called <strong>Singleton</strong> that restricts the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class blueprint. | This is done using the 'new' keyword followed by the class name, which allocates memory for the object and calls its constructor to initialize the object's state. Instantiated objects have their own identity and state, allowing them to interact with other objects and methods in the program. It's important to note that instantiation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, as it enables the creation of multiple instances of a class, each with its own unique characteristics and behavior.">instantiation</a> of a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a class is one of the fundamental concepts used to develop the logic of a program. | It is a template that defines properties and behaviors of objects. Fields in a class describe the properties of an object, while methods describe what an object can do. Classes can be divided into two groups: instance and static. Instance methods are unique to each instance of a class and can access and modify the state of that instance. Custom classes can be created to define fields and methods that are tailored to specific purposes.">class</a> to one <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an object is an instance of a particular class that defines its properties and possible behaviors. | Each object has its own state, separated from other objects, and is accessed using a reference, which stores the memory address where the actual object is located. Objects from the standard library, such as String and Date, as well as programmer-defined classes, are all reference types. The new keyword is used to create an object of a particular class. For example, String str = new String(hello); creates a new String object with the value hello. Objects have a unique identity, can be managed, and have a human-readable representation.">object</a>. The pattern ensures that there is only one <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3549" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance refers to an object that is created from a class blueprint. | It represents a specific entity with its own set of attributes and behaviors. For example, in the context of comparing two instances of the class, it means comparing two objects created from the same class but possibly with different values. Instances have access to instance methods, which are methods that belong to each object created from the class. This means that each instance can have its own unique state, and the instance method can access and manipulate this state. To create an instance of a class, you can either call the constructor directly or use the `new` keyword. Additionally, you can obtain an instance of a class by having a reference to a class, such as through an object or a class literal.">instance of</a> the class and provides global access to it for the outer world.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The same instance is used by different clients (classes, methods)</p>
<p>Singletons often control access to resources such as database connections or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4942" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a socket is an interface that allows for sending and receiving data between different processes (running programs) in a bidirectional manner. | It is identified by a combination of a computer's address in the network, such as localhost, and a port number on that machine. A port is an integer number ranging from 0 to 65535, preferably greater than 1023. For example, a socket's address may look like this: localhost:1234. To initiate communication, one program called a client creates a socket to request a connection with another program called a server. The client uses the server's machine address and a specific port number where the server listens for incoming requests. The server waits for new requests and either accepts or denies them. If a request is accepted, the server creates a socket for interaction with the client. Both the client and server can send data to each other using their sockets.">sockets</a>.</p>
<p>For example, a class that keeps the connection to the database can be written as a singleton: creating a connection object time after time will be quite bulky in terms of memory. If it is a singleton, then your application will work better and faster.</p>

<p>The standard way to write a class according to the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/26422" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists at any given time. | This is achieved through the use of a static creational method that always returns the same instance of the class. The singleton pattern is beneficial in scenarios where a single instance of a class is required to be shared across an entire application, such as in multi-threaded and database applications, caching, logging, and configuration modules. It helps save system resources by reusing a single instance of an object instead of creating it multiple times. However, some consider the singleton pattern to be an anti-pattern, as it is frequently used where it is not beneficial and can impose limitations.">singleton pattern</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a private <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a constructor is a special method that initializes a new object of a class. | It has the same name as the class that contains it, and it has no return type. Constructors set values to the fields when the object is created, and they can take parameters for initializing fields with specific values. A class can have multiple constructors, which is known as constructor overloading. This allows for flexibility when creating objects of the class, as the appropriate constructor can be chosen based on the context and the data available at the time of object creation. Constructors can also call each other, allowing for complex initialization logic to be split across multiple constructors. Constructors are explicitly defined in a class and are used to initialize all fields with their default values. If a specific constructor is defined, the default constructor will not be created. A no-argument constructor is useful in cases when any default value is better than no value at all.">constructor</a> to defeat the creation of instances using the keyword <code class="language-java">new</code>;</li>
<li>a private static <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a> of the class that is the only instance of the class;</li>
<li>a public <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static method</a> to return the same instance of the class; this is a global access point to the instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code implements these concepts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Singleton {

    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>That class is quite simple, but let's take a closer look at it.</p>
<p>The class <code class="language-java">Singleton</code> is a basic implementation of the considered pattern. The field <code class="language-java">INSTANCE</code> stores only a single instance of the class. The constructor is declared as <code class="language-java">private</code> to defeat instantiation. The static method <code class="language-java">getInstance</code> returns the same instance of the class.</p>
<p>Let's create three variables, assign an instance to each of them and then compare the variables by references:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Singleton s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
Singleton s2 = Singleton.getInstance();
Singleton s3 = Singleton.getInstance();
        
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true because s1 and s2 refer the same object
System.out.println(s2 == s3); // true because s2 and s3 refer the same object</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, the variables <code class="language-java">s1</code><code class="language-java">s2</code>, and <code class="language-java">s3</code> refer the same object that is stored in the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static field is a field declared with the `static` keyword that is shared by all objects of a class, rather than belonging to an individual instance. | It can hold any primitive or reference type, and all instances of the class share the same value for a static field. Static fields are useful for storing global variables that all instances of a class should share, as they help save memory by not creating separate copies for each instance. However, it's typically not recommended to declare non-final public static fields, as they can be accessed and modified by any code that has access to the class. Additionally, it's important to note that static fields cannot access instance fields or methods, as there is no instance context.">static field</a> of <code class="language-java">Singleton</code>.</p>
<p>Usually, singletons have additional <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance field is a field declared with the keyword instance variable that is associated with an object (instance) of a class, rather than the class itself. | It can hold any primitive or reference type, and each object of the class has its own unique instance field value, which can be different from other objects of the same class. Instance fields can be accessed within the class using the this keyword. They are often used to store and manipulate the state of an object, and provide more functionality compared to static fields.">instance fields</a> to store values (global variables) to share them across your application as well as methods to have a behavior.</p>
<h5 id="lazy-initialization" style="text-align: center;">Lazy initialization</h5>
<p>The singleton above loads the instance when the class is loaded. But sometimes the initialization of a singleton can take much time: for example, to load the values of the fields from a file or a database.</p>
<p>The following implementation loads the instance only if it is needed by a client (who calls <code class="language-java">getInstance</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Singleton {
    
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton () { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though the implementation of a singleton pattern contains few lines of code, it has an important feature: <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/26422" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, lazy initialization is a design pattern that delays the creation of an object or the execution of a method until it is actually needed. | This approach can be useful when the initialization process is time-consuming or resource-intensive, as it allows you to postpone the cost of initialization until the point of use. In the context of the provided text, lazy initialization is used in the implementation of a singleton pattern. The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it. By using lazy initialization, the singleton instance is not created until the method that returns the instance is called for the first time. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary initialization. It's important to note that lazy initialization can introduce thread-safety issues, especially in a multi-threaded environment.">lazy initialization</a>. It means that the singleton instance is not created until the <code class="language-java">getInstance</code> method is called for the first time. This technique ensures that singleton instances are created only when needed.</p>

<h5 id="criticism" style="text-align: center;">Criticism</h5>
<p>Some criticize the singleton pattern and consider it to be an anti-pattern: it is frequently used where it is not beneficial, it imposes unnecessary restrictions in some situations and introduces global state into an application.
