<p><strong>Template Method</strong> is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a behavioral pattern is a design pattern that is concerned with the interaction between objects. | There are about 12 design patterns that belong to this category, with the command pattern being one of the most commonly used. The purpose of the command pattern is to decouple the logic between a command and its consumer. It encapsulates all the data related to a command in one object, which typically consists of a set of methods, their parameters, and one or more objects that these methods belong to. This decoupling allows for flexibility, as changing a command does not affect its consumer. Other behavioral patterns include the state pattern, which is useful when the behavior of a class depends on its current state and changes during runtime.">behavioral pattern</a> that describes the common algorithm while <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3585" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a subclass is a class that is derived from another class, also known as a superclass or base class. | Subclasses inherit all public and protected fields and methods from their superclass and can also add new fields and methods. A subclass can be referred to using either a subclass reference or a superclass reference, which can refer to any subclass object derived from that superclass. Java does not support multiple-class inheritance, meaning that a class can only inherit from a single superclass, but a superclass can have multiple subclasses.">subclasses</a> implement steps of this <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3556" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an algorithm is a set of instructions, written in the form of code, to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. | The Strategy pattern in Java encapsulates a family of algorithms, each in a separate class, making them interchangeable within that family. This allows for easier addition of new algorithms and more concise code. The algorithm executed in different branches are moved into their own class, and a common interface is determined for a family of algorithms, which should contain one or more abstract methods.">algorithm</a>. This pattern lets the subclasses implement the steps of the algorithm without changing that algorithm's skeleton.</p>
<p>As an example of the <strong>Template Method</strong>, we will consider the working process. The algorithm contains three steps: go to work, work, go home. It's a very true-to-life example indeed.</p>
<p>Suppose all workers go to work and go home in an absolutely identical manner. The working routine, however, is different and depends on the workerâ€™s qualification. We can choose any profession, but the algorithm remains the same.</p>

<p>An <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3597" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an abstract class is a class declared with the keyword abstract and represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses. | It typically contains a set of fields and methods that are shared among all classes within a hierarchy. Abstract classes have special features, including abstract methods, which are declared by adding the keyword abstract and have a declaration (modifier, return type, and signature) but don't have an implementation. Each concrete (non-abstract) subclass must implement these abstract methods. An abstract class cannot be instantiated, meaning that you cannot create an object of an abstract class.">abstract</a> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a base class, also known as a superclass or parent class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods. A parent class can have multiple child classes, but a child class can only have one parent class due to Java's single inheritance feature. The parent class reference can be used to refer to any subclass object derived from that superclass. An abstract class is often used as a base class in a hierarchy, and it represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses.">base class</a> implements standard algorithm steps and can provide a default <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/36545" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an implementation refers to the specific way of implementing a method or an interface. | It provides the concrete functionality for the methods declared in an interface. In the context of the provided passage, there are many implementations of the interface in Java, each backed by different principles. For instance, when you have an interface that represents a map, there might be several classes implementing this interface, each providing a different way to order and store data. Implementations help to extend functionality and maintain backward compatibility in Java.">implementation</a> for custom steps. Specific subclasses provide concrete implementation for each of these steps.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Class</strong> describes <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5035" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive is one of the eight built-in data types provided by the language, represented by keywords and not objects, unlike reference types. | Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of value. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions. Primitive types are not objects, and they are not created using the `new` keyword.">primitive</a> operations and the template method itself which calls primitive <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3612" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an operation is a function or method that performs a specific task on data. | In the context of streams, operations are categorized into intermediate and terminal. Intermediate operations, such as filter, map, and distinct, return a new stream and can be chained. Terminal operations, such as forEach and reduce, return a result or side effect and signal the end of the stream pipeline. Additionally, operations can be classified as filtering, mapping/modifying, or reducing/combining, with examples including distinct, sorted, and min. These concepts are essential for processing data effectively with streams in Java.">operations</a>;</p>

<h5 id="practice-example" style="text-align: center;">Practice example</h5>
<p>To demonstrate how the Template Method works, let's create an abstract class <code class="language-java">Worker</code> that describes the working routine. Then, let's add the template method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public abstract class Worker {

    public void work() {
        goToWork();

        workingProcess();

        goHome();
    }

    public void goToWork() {
        System.out.println("= I'm going to work sadly =");
    }

    public void goHome() {
        System.out.println("= I'm going home happy =");
    }

    public abstract void workingProcess();
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>The common algorithm of actions is already determined. Now, we will create two <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a concrete class is a class that implements or extends a generic class or interface and provides concrete, non-generic types for its type parameters. | When creating an instance of a generic class, you must specify a concrete type that will replace the type parameter. This means that instead of using primitive types, you must use wrapper classes such as Integer, Double, or Character when creating an object of a generic class. A concrete class can process many different types in the same way, making it a powerful tool for writing flexible and reusable code.">concrete classes</a>: <code class="language-java">Programmer</code><strong> </strong>and <code class="language-java">Actor</code><strong>:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
public class Programmer extends Worker {

    @Override
    public void workingProcess() {
        System.out.println(" &gt; I'm a programmer");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I drink coffee");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I write code");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I drink coffee again");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I write code again");
    }
}

public class Actor extends Worker {

    @Override
    public void workingProcess() {
        System.out.println(" &gt; I'm an actor");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I read a scenario");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I get used to role ");
        System.out.println(" &gt; I play a role");
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>In the <code class="language-java">TemplateMethodDemo</code> class we create programmer and actor instances and call the template method :</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class TemplateMethodDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Worker programmer = new Programmer();
        Worker actor = new Actor();
        programmer.work();
        actor.work();
    }
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Template Method</strong> is applicable in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the behavior of an algorithm can vary, you let subclasses implement the behavior through <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3539" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, overriding is a mechanism that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a superclass method. | When a method is overridden, the name and parameter of the subclass method must be exactly the same as the superclass method. However, the return type can be the same as the superclass method or a subtype of it. This feature is known as the covariant return type. Overriding enables subclasses to redefine behavior inherited from their superclass, allowing them to add their own unique flair to inherited methods.">overriding</a>;</p>
